# 🚦 Traffic Accident Pattern Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify important patterns and trends related to road accidents.  
Using Python and Google Colab, the project explores how factors like **day**, **time**, **weather**, and **cause** influence accident occurrences and severity.

The goal is to gain data-driven insights that can help improve **road safety awareness and decision-making**.  

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze accident distribution across days and time periods  
- Identify high-risk weather conditions  
- Determine the most common causes of accidents  
- Visualize patterns using charts for better understanding  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Google Colab  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

## 📂 Dataset
A sample traffic accident dataset is created directly within the notebook, containing:
- Accident ID  
- Day of the week  
- Time of day  
- Weather condition  
- Cause of accident  
- Severity level  

This makes the project **easy to run without external files**.

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Accidents by day of the week  
- Accidents by time (Morning / Evening / Night)  
- Weather-wise accident analysis  
- Cause-wise accident frequency  
- Severity pattern identification  

## 📈 Visualizations
- Bar charts showing accident frequency by:
  - Day  
  - Time  
  - Weather condition  
- Clear and simple plots for easy interpretation  

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Night-time accidents are more frequent  
- Rainy and foggy weather conditions show higher risk  
- Speeding and drunk driving are major accident causes  
- Weekends tend to have increased accident counts  


## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**  
2. Run all cells step by step  
3. View analysis results and visualizations  

## 💼 Use Case
