# 🚦 Traffic Accident Pattern Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is about analyzing traffic accident data to understand common patterns and trends related to road accidents.  
The analysis is done using **Python in Google Colab**, focusing on factors such as **day**, **time**, **weather conditions**, and **cause of accidents**.

The main aim of this project is to gain useful insights that can help in improving **road safety awareness and better decision-making**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Study how accidents vary across different days and times  
- Identify weather conditions that increase accident risk  
- Find the most common reasons behind accidents  
- Present insights clearly using simple visualizations  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Google Colab  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib 

## 📂 Dataset
For this project, a sample traffic accident dataset is created directly inside the notebook.  
The dataset includes:
- Accident ID  
- Day of the week  
- Time of day  
- Weather condition  
- Cause of accident  
- Severity level  

Since the data is created within the notebook, the project is easy to run without downloading any external files.

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Analysis of accidents based on the day of the week  
- Time-based accident analysis (Morning, Evening, Night)  
- Weather-wise accident comparison  
- Cause-wise accident frequency  
- Identification of accident severity patterns  

## 📈 Visualizations
- Bar charts to show accident distribution by:
  - Day  
  - Time  
  - Weather condition  
- Simple and clear plots for easy understanding  

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Accidents are more frequent during night-time  
- Rainy and foggy weather conditions show higher risk  
- Speeding and drunk driving are major causes of accidents  
- Accident counts tend to increase on weekends  

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**  
2. Run each cell step by step  
3. Observe the outputs and visualizations  

## 💼 Use Case
- Beginner-friendly data analytics project  
- Helpful for academic learning and practice  
- Can be included in GitHub and resume portfolios
